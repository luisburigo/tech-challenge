## Tech Challenge

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to see how is your level of proficiency with the JavaScript stack that we use on our projects. Please notice that during interviews
we can ask some questions about your decisions.

## Summary

Build a simple FullStack application using JavaScript. (Back-End and Front-End)

All the code should be upload inside a single *private* repository on GitHub. Add the user @luisburigo and @guimroque as a contributor.

## Story

As a grocery owner, I need to control the stock of my store.
For this, I need to have a way to create, update, and delete the items on my stock.
To have good control of the stock, I need to have at least `barcode, name, quantity, and price` of each product.

Would be awesome for me to have some way to differentiate the products with less than 100 items in stock on the dashboard to be able
to buy more of those.

## Back-End

Create an API using Node.JS, select the frameworks you prefer. The Application should use REST or GraphQL. It's up to you! =)

## Front-End

Create a SPA using React and other libraries you prefer.

Design is not the most important thing here but it matters! Prefer to use ready libraries like https://material-ui.com/

## Go Go

Do in the way you think is smarter and faster, we value:
- Creativity
- Productivity
- Reliability
- Communication

### If you have any questions, let me know.
